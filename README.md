## Teams

## Strategy
Closest Potential Competitor: MyFitnessPal  
MyFitnessPal is a widely-used fitness and nutrition tracking app that helps users track their daily food intake, exercise routines, and progress toward their health and wellness goals. The app offers a large database of foods and exercises, a barcode scanner for easy food tracking, and integration with various fitness devices and apps.  
  
Case Study:  
MyFitnessPal was founded in 2005 by Mike Lee and Albert Lee, who wanted a simple way to track their diets and exercise routines. They launched the app in 2009, which quickly gained popularity due to its user-friendly interface and extensive food database. In 2015, the company was acquired by Under Armour for $475 million.

### Key Learnings for Health Harvest:  
1. User Experience: MyFitnessPal's success can be largely attributed to its focus on delivering a user-friendly experience. Health Harvest should prioritize creating an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate and understand.
2. Comprehensive Database: MyFitnessPal's extensive food and exercise database sets it apart from competitors. Health Harvest should aim to develop an equally comprehensive database and consider partnering with other companies to expand its offerings.
3. Integration: The ability to connect MyFitnessPal with various fitness devices and apps has been a significant factor in its success. Health Harvest should focus on seamless integration with popular fitness wearables, apps, and other health-related tools to provide a comprehensive user experience.
4. Community Engagement: MyFitnessPal has fostered a strong user community through its blog, social media channels, and user forums. Health Harvest should prioritize building a supportive and engaged community to promote user retention and long-term success.
5. Partnerships and Acquisitions: MyFitnessPal's acquisition by Under Armour has allowed it to benefit from the resources and reach of a larger company. Health Harvest should be open to strategic partnerships and acquisitions that can help accelerate growth and expand its offerings.
  
By learning from MyFitnessPal's success and focusing on user experience, comprehensive databases, seamless integration, community engagement, and strategic partnerships, Health Harvest can maximize its potential and establish itself as a leading player in the health and fitness app market.

# Cultural Policy
## Core Values
Transparency is essential to building trust with our users. At the forefront of building trust with users is how we manage their data. By storing user data locally on their devices, we give all the control to the user. Only if a user decides to monetize, then we have access to their data. And when we have access, we will be committed to being open and honest about how we use their data; further giving them control over their information. Being completely transparent about how user data is stored and handled anchors us to our goal of being user centered. We believe that our users are the heart of our business. By committing to design our app around their needs and preferences, we will provide the best experience possible to them. This further includes always striving to provide them with exceptional customer service. We should always continue to innovate our platform to deliver the best user experience possible. Having the best user experience also involves inclusivity because everyone deserves access to tools and resources that can help them improve their health and fitness.Thus, we are committed to designing our app to be inclusive and accessible to all. In summary, our number one priority is to serve the user by committing to conduct our business with the highest ethical standards.  
  
## Motivation
Our motivation is to make the health and fitness journey an enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone. We would love to provide users with the tools and resources they need to reach their goals and live healthier lives. We would also rather have our users be fairly compensated for their health data rather than it being taken by other health tracking companies. We fear that users will be overwhelmed by the complexity of navigating their health data, or that their data will be misused or mishandled.

Privacy and health above all.
