## Teams

## Strategy
Closest Potential Competitor: MyFitnessPal  
MyFitnessPal is a widely-used fitness and nutrition tracking app that helps users track their daily food intake, exercise routines, and progress toward their health and wellness goals. The app offers a large database of foods and exercises, a barcode scanner for easy food tracking, and integration with various fitness devices and apps.  
  
Case Study:  
MyFitnessPal was founded in 2005 by Mike Lee and Albert Lee, who wanted a simple way to track their diets and exercise routines. They launched the app in 2009, which quickly gained popularity due to its user-friendly interface and extensive food database. In 2015, the company was acquired by Under Armour for $475 million.

### Key Learnings for Health Harvest:  
1. User Experience: MyFitnessPal's success can be largely attributed to its focus on delivering a user-friendly experience. Health Harvest should prioritize creating an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate and understand.
2. Comprehensive Database: MyFitnessPal's extensive food and exercise database sets it apart from competitors. Health Harvest should aim to develop an equally comprehensive database and consider partnering with other companies to expand its offerings.
3. Integration: The ability to connect MyFitnessPal with various fitness devices and apps has been a significant factor in its success. Health Harvest should focus on seamless integration with popular fitness wearables, apps, and other health-related tools to provide a comprehensive user experience.
4. Community Engagement: MyFitnessPal has fostered a strong user community through its blog, social media channels, and user forums. Health Harvest should prioritize building a supportive and engaged community to promote user retention and long-term success.
5. Partnerships and Acquisitions: MyFitnessPal's acquisition by Under Armour has allowed it to benefit from the resources and reach of a larger company. Health Harvest should be open to strategic partnerships and acquisitions that can help accelerate growth and expand its offerings.
  
By learning from MyFitnessPal's success and focusing on user experience, comprehensive databases, seamless integration, community engagement, and strategic partnerships, Health Harvest can maximize its potential and establish itself as a leading player in the health and fitness app market.

Make your fitness great again!

# Cultural Policy
## Core Values
Transparency is essential to building trust with our users. At the forefront of building trust with users is how we manage their data. By storing user data locally on their devices, we give all the control to the user. Only if a user decides to monetize, then we have access to their data. And when we have access, we will be committed to being open and honest about how we use their data; further giving them control over their information. Being completely transparent about how user data is stored and handled anchors us to our goal of being user centered. We believe that our users are the heart of our business. By committing to design our app around their needs and preferences, we will provide the best experience possible to them. This further includes always striving to provide them with exceptional customer service. We should always continue to innovate our platform to deliver the best user experience possible. Having the best user experience also involves inclusivity because everyone deserves access to tools and resources that can help them improve their health and fitness.Thus, we are committed to designing our app to be inclusive and accessible to all. In summary, our number one priority is to serve the user by committing to conduct our business with the highest ethical standards.  
  
## Motivation
Our motivation is to make the health and fitness journey an enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone. We would love to provide users with the tools and resources they need to reach their goals and live healthier lives. We would also rather have our users be fairly compensated for their health data rather than it being taken by other health tracking companies. We fear that users will be overwhelmed by the complexity of navigating their health data, or that their data will be misused or mishandled.  
  
## Summary
Privacy and health above all.

# Experimentation & Priorities
## Experimentation (OKRs of Strategy)
### 1. Develop minimally viable product for the Health Harvest app
Experiment:  
- First quarter of the year after company launch: Create an app prototype using the app prototyping platform Sketch. Have team members, their friends, and their peers rate various app features on a scale  of 1-8. Having an even number of rating points disallows raters from giving a middle rating for every feature. The categories for testing would include: Ease of data entry, ease of navigation, clarity of labeling, visual style, functionality for data tracking, and overall rating for the app. Iterate on feedback until an above average rating is met for the users. 
- Second through third quarter after company launch: Begin development across both ios and android platforms. Monthly surveying of the app and its features like in part one would continue. A/B testing would also be introduced for app features. This would include interface changes, color or button placement, and different screen layouts. A soft alpha stage launch for developer’s peers would occur by the end of the second quarter as well. Focus would move to testing the app running on consumer devices.
- Beta Launch of the app to the public should occur around the start of the fourth quarter. Rapid changes to features would occur based on user feedback both through app store reviews and feedback portals prompted to the users. 

### 2. Increase user acquisition and retention
Experiments:  
- Gamify user acquisition through the use of referral programs. If a customer manages to refer 5 other users, they get added to a pool that will randomly draw winners to be a preferred member of the app. Every 5 new referrals is another entry. These members would get exclusive access to customer support lines, and would also be first in line to try out new app features. 
- We would Conduct search engine advertising campaigns using platforms like Youtube Ads and Google Ads to attract potential users.
- User retention analysis would also occur at this time. Surveying inactive users (users that have not used the app in over 3 months) to see why they stopped using the app. Fix recurring instances of negative sentiment among departed users.  
  
A potential survey would look like this:  
1. What were the main reasons you stopped using the Health Harvest app?
2. How easy was it for you to navigate and use Health Harvest?
3. Were there any features that you felt were missing or could have been improved?
4. Did you encounter any technical difficulties or bugs while using Health Harvest?
5. How frequently did you use the Health Harvest app to track your fitness activities?
6. How satisfied were you with the Health Harvest app’s overall performance?
7. Did you feel that Health Harvest helped you reach your fitness goals?
8. Would you consider using Health Harvest again in the future?
9. Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with fitness tracking in Health Harvest?

### 3. Expand the range of integrated health and fitness tools
- Have focus groups look at possible brands that we are interested in working with to see what would be the best cultural fit for collaboration with our brand.
- Have 3 of our possible brands with about 3 of their possible wrist band designs on our wrist watch fitness tracking product.
- Focus groups will test for best comfort,ease of use, and looks.
- Each focus group will consist of 5-10 persons who were found with Google Forms. These people are looking for a better fitness app and wearable item.
  
Focus group would be asked:  
1. Before showing wristbands, What are you looking for in a brand?
2. Any ethical dilemmas with current brands shown? 
3. What materials would be best suited for your needs in a wristband?
4. To test for ease of use we will have the focus group try on the wristbands without telling them how to put and take off the wrist bands.
5. Asking questions like, “Is this what you were expecting?”, and seeing what they respond with.
6. After having the group test the wristbands ask if they have any suggestions to see if there were any major problems with the bands.
  
## Priorites 
Health Harvest is setting priority to creating a working health fitness application before anything. We are hoping to have viable product within a year. We are going to be using products like Figma.com, Sketch.com and InVision. To develop the app using a cross-platform development process like React Native or Flutter to streamline the development process.  
  
We want to perform usability testing with a small group of potential users to gather feedback and iterate on the design. Then launch a beta version of the app and invite potential users to test it, gathering their feedback to improve the final version.
